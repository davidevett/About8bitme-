- This project gave me insight on how to style a page and found it exciting.


## Installation

- The project was originally installed from Gitlab. I cloned the project to my computer and soon began. 

## Usage

- The previous editior used only div elements to separate sections causing confusion in all following editors in the program
- Appropriate semantic names replaced them to help organize the project. 
- There were issuses in CSS file following the corrections because discrepancieswhich was easily corrected 
- Along with misnaming the files there were issues with too much code in the CSS file, clutering the file up. Though this was technically corrrect we went through and condensed the the code to make the following edits easier.
